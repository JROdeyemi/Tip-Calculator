This is a tip calculator that helps you calculate how much your total cost will be when you add a tip for the waiter at the restaurant. 
It also goes further to help you share the bill. 
If you are bad at maths like me, and you always struggle with how much each person has to pay when you and your friends go out to eat, do not worry anymore. 
This is your solution. You can make use of it here - https://replit.com/@Josimal360/tip-calculator-start#main.py
